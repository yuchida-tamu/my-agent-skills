Update the user's tech trend digest preferences.

1. Read the current preferences from `memory/tech-trend-digest-preferences.md` and show them.
2. Ask the user what they want to change using AskUserQuestion — language, topics, or both.
3. Apply the changes and overwrite the preferences file.
4. Confirm the updated preferences.

If the user provided specifics in their message (e.g., "add Security" or "switch to Japanese"),
apply those directly without re-asking.
